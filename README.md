# Scaling The Scattering Transform
This repository contains the experiments found in the paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.08961.pdf

### Requirements
In order to run our experiments you will need the following: pytorch,opencv,pyscatwave package.
The simplest way to install pytorch and opencv is through anaconda. We recommend python 2.7 + anaconda.
The pyscatwave package can be found here https://github.com/edouardoyallon/pyscatwave

### Imagenet
We provide a pre-trained model similar to the one described in the paper. 

To run the scattering+resnet:
1) Download from  ED PUT LINK HERE
2) Add this to the imagenet/ directory
3) Run the script main_test.py to evaluate on the ILSVRC validation set

To apply the SLE as a feature extractor:
1) Download from ED PUT LINK
2) ED MAKE TOY EXAMPLE

### STL-10
Simply run python main_STL.py script in the STL directory

### CIFAR-10
To run the small sample experiments
