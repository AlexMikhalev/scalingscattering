## Scaling The Scattering Transform
This repository contains the experiments found in the paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.08961.pdf


# Imagenet
We provide a pre-trained model similar to the one described in the paper. 

To run the scattering+resnet:
1) Download from  ED PUT LINK HERE
2) Add this to the imagenet/ directory
3) Run the script main_test.py to evaluate on the ILSVRC validation set

To apply the SLE as a feature extractor:
1) Download from ED PUT LINK
2) ED MAKE TOY EXAMPLE

# STL-10
Simply run python main_STL.py script in the STL directory

# CIFAR-10
To run the small sample experiments
